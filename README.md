# NoStamina-SKSE
based on: https://github.com/malus741/NoStaminaConsumptionOutsideCombat  slightly changed + updated for GOG

the changes are only subtle but it helped me a ton to understand how to get started with SKSE plugins

**Changes:**
- No Stamina Consumption, neither out of combat, nor in combat
- updated for the latest CommonLib-NG to work with the GOG version of the game

### I'm still in the midst of figuring out how that works, don't expect it to be the best way to do it. 
**does currently only work for SSE and AE and GOG. not for VR**
